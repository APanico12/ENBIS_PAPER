# ‚ö° Extreme Tail Risk in European Electricity Markets

## ‚ùó Why It Matters

In a context of growing **instability in European energy markets**, understanding how **extreme shocks** affect the **joint behavior of electricity prices** is critical.

Traditional correlation measures (like **Pearson** or **Spearman**) fail to capture what really matters during a crisis: the **co-movement of extreme negative returns**. These are the moments when **systemic risk** emerges, threatening the stability of the entire energy system.

Electricity markets are especially sensitive due to:

- **Nonlinear and volatile price dynamics**
- Exposure to **exogenous shocks** (e.g., geopolitical tensions, weather anomalies, fuel shortages)
- Strong interconnections across countries

Monitoring these tail co-dependencies is crucial for:

- Identifying vulnerabilities in the energy system  
- Supporting **risk allocation and management**
- Designing **resilient, evidence-based energy policies**

## üß† Methodology

This study applies a **nonparametric network-based approach** to measure **tail dependence** between country-level electricity prices, focusing on the **lower tail** (i.e., extreme negative returns) using the **Extreme Downside Correlation (EDC)**.

### üî¢ Step 1: Daily Log Returns

For each country $i$, we define the **daily log return** as:

$$
R_{i,t} = 100 \times (\log P_{i,t} - \log P_{i,t-1})
$$

Where:
- $P_{i,t}$ is the day-ahead electricity price
- Returns are expressed in percentage terms

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 2: Tail Risk with Value-at-Risk (VaR)

To isolate extreme events, we compute the **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** at a given confidence level $\tau \in (0, 1)$:

$$
VaR_{i,\tau} = F^{-1}_{R_i}(\tau)
$$

Where:
- $F_{R_i}$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of returns
- $\tau$ controls the severity (e.g., $\tau = 0.01$ captures the worst 1%)

---

### üåê Step 3: Extreme Downside Correlation (EDC)

The **EDC** between two countries $i$ and $j$ is defined as:

$$
EDC_{\tau,ij} = \frac{\sum_t (R_{i,t} - \mu_i)^\tau \cdot (R_{j,t} - \mu_j)^\tau}{\sqrt{\sum_t (R_{i,t} - \mu_i)^{2\tau}} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_t (R_{j,t} - \mu_j)^{2\tau}}}
$$

With:

$$
(R_{i,t} - \mu_i)^\tau = 
\begin{cases}
R_{i,t} - \mu_i, & \text{if } R_{i,t} < VaR_{i,\tau} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This metric captures **how strongly two countries move together during extreme downside periods**, which is what matters most for energy stability and crisis management.

---

### üîó Step 4: Network Construction

- Each country = a **node**
- Each EDC value = a **weighted edge**

From these EDC matrices, we construct **networks** to visualize and analyze how strongly countries are connected during extreme price drops.

---

### üìä Step 5: Network Density

To measure overall interconnectedness during crises, we compute the **network density**:

$$
\text{Density}(W) = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i \neq j} |W_{ij}|
$$

Where $W_{ij}$ is the EDC value between country $i$ and $j$, and $n$ is the number of countries.

A higher density indicates more **simultaneous extreme events**, suggesting increased systemic risk.

---

### üîÅ Step 6: Rolling Window Analysis

To capture the **evolution of tail risk** over time, we use a **rolling window approach**:

- **Window size**: 365 days
- **Period analyzed**: 01/01/2020 ‚Äì 01/01/2024
- **Total windows**: 1,365

This approach reveals how **interconnections and vulnerabilities change dynamically**, especially around major events (e.g., the 2022 gas crisis).

---

## üìå Conclusions


The analysis highlighted the effectiveness of the network density index as a tool for identifying risk periods in the European energy market. Using a 365-day rolling window, the index tracked the evolution of interconnections during extreme events, revealing a major phase of systemic stress from June to October 2022. The EDC method was particularly effective in uncovering latent dependencies, with clusters showing how regional interdependencies and market integration influence joint risk exposure.

Countries in Southeast Europe (SEE) such as Greece, Croatia, and Hungary share vulnerabilities due to infrastructure constraints and gas dependency, while Central European (Germany, Netherlands, Czech Republic) and Iberian (Spain, Portugal) markets demonstrate strong internal integration. Medium-level correlations, including Italy's cross-border ties and the Estonia‚ÄìFinland‚ÄìNordic connection, confirm the role of physical interconnections and shared risks.

Overall, combining the network density index and EDC matrix helped identify critical periods and map countries based on shared risk exposure. Countries in the same cluster are more vulnerable to simultaneous shocks during stress, while isolated countries face more individual risks. These findings stress the importance of monitoring market connectivity and interdependence to better manage future energy crises.

The EDC network can be integrated into early warning systems for the EU electricity market, helping regulators detect contagion risks. This framework can also simulate stress scenarios and assess shock propagation. Clusters with high tail dependence point to critical interconnections where resilience should be strengthened, through backup capacity and storage. The results also advocate for more coordinated EU policies during energy crises, particularly in shaping capacity mechanisms and demand response systems.
